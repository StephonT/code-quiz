# Code-Quiz

## Starter Code

I was given this project from the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. I was provided with the html, css, highscores page and a few lines of code inside of a JavaScript file. The code inside of the JavaScript file was enough to where I was able to begin the project, however, I had to finish the rest of the code to get a fully functioning Code Quiz. Please see the <strong>Purpose</strong> section below.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with the DOM, "setting" and "getting" data in the local storage, and event delegation just to name a few. This project was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Assignment

User Story:

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

In this code, I was able to achieve all the acceptance criteria for the user. Please see link below.
