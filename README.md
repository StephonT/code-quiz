# Code-Quiz

## Starter Code

I was given this project from the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. I was provided with the html, css, highscores page and a few lines of code inside of a JavaScript file. The code inside of the JavaScript file was enough to where I was able to begin the project, however, I had to finish the rest of the code to get a fully functioning Code Quiz. Please see the <strong>Purpose</strong> section below.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with the DOM, "setting" and "getting" data in the local storage, and event delegation just to name a few. This project was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Assignment

User Story:
